## Support Subscription

A Rockstor Incident-Based support subscription is a flexible pay-as-you-go add-on for [Stable Channel](https://rockstor.com/docs/update-channels/update_channels.html#stable-channel) subscribers.
An incident is defined as a question relating to a specific, discrete issue, and may involve several interactions with the Rockstor team prior to that issue's resolution:

Example incidents:

- Custom configuration or package install.
- Help with deployment and monitoring setup.
- Help with performance troubleshooting.
