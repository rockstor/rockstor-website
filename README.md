# Contributions
This repo is periodically published to:

[rockstor.com](https://rockstor.com/)

For contribution guidelines, see: [Contributing to Rockstor documentation](https://rockstor.com/docs/contribute_documentation.html).
For content additions/changes please stick to **one sentence per line** as this helps with translations and reviews of changes.
Really long sentences may be broken at punctuation points.
See [Semantic Linefeeds](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/) which sites Brian W. Kernighan (1974).
Our EULA content is the one exception: to aid in tracking upstream.

Our [privacy_policy](https://rockstor.com/privacy_policy.html) has "... no cookies are used." for this site.
So we cannot include such things as for example the Hugo YouTube embed build-in shortcode.
Even with "[privacyEnhanced](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#youtube) = true" our visitors will still incur cookies.
Instead use "See YouTube video-title-as-watch-link".

## Debug build
The minimum version of Hugo required is indicated in the top level config file "config.toml".
Be sure to increase this value if a newer Hugo feature is used.
See the [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) doc section for how to run Hugo locally.
You can then build and test your changes locally by running (in the top directory of this repo):

    hugo server -D

The local http site generated is usually at: http://localhost:1313/ and the baseURL config is ignored for this preview.

## Final build
The production build is generated by the following command:

    hugo

Which creates and populates the intended document root content under ./public/.
Note that pre-existing files in ./public are not removed.
So it is best to first delete any prior ./public directory before running this command.

# Current State
The contents represents our Hugo re-do our our prior existing web-site, and is a work in progress.
There is no additional theme requirement as we have our own custom layout for all elements; developed from scratch.
If you see any anomalies or Hugo inelegancies/errors then please consider contributing a pull request.

# History
This website was initially developed using a Python based static site generator believed to be [hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde).
Things happened and likely required modifications out grew the generator and we were left with a semi machine generated mess.
In time we then transitioned to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using our own layout files, i.e. no external theme.
This was done primarily to aid maintenance/use and to include our website development in our community endeavours.

# Hopes 
We want to add French & European Portuguese etc translations.
But we must first enable and configure Hugo's built-in multi lingual capabilities.
This is to be tackled in a dedicated GitHub issue.
If you are game to offer any translations then please be patient as we work towards this capability.
